# Thought Leaders

The internet is full of **Thought Leaders**. They exist everywhere - tweeting, blogging, sometimes even appearing in person - always leading with their thoughts. 

No one, to my knowledge, has assembled the authoritative list of internet thought leaders (known to us on the inside as "TLs"; other acceptable terms are **Key Opinion Leaders** and **Luminaries**.) It is my hope that this will be a living list of such individuals. 

### How To Contribute A Thought Leader

Fork this repo and send a pull request. Myself and/or other approved TLs will review submissions. You can also [file a new issue](https://github.com/PharkMillups/thought-leaders/issues/new) asking to add a specific thought leader. Make sure to be explicit. Additionally, you can add areas of expertise to existing thought leaders that may have been overlooked. 

### Disclaimer

In case it isn't obvious, this is a joke. What's worse, it's riddled with insides jokes. If your name ends up on here and you don't want it to be, tell me and I'll happily remove it. If for some reason this joke upsets you, I'm sorry. Email me and tell me why so we can talk about it.
